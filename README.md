# Blog App
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

View code on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/blog_app) and the live preview on [Heroku](https://warm-dusk-33597.herokuapp.com/).

### Functionality

This is the [Blog App](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/ruby-on-rails-ruby-on-rails) project, where I put together the very rudimentary functionality of a blog.

### Thoughts

After a lot of reading about Ruby on Rails, this was my first Rails app! It was exciting to finally get to jump in and see how the different parts of the MVC work together. It's all new to me, so I can't say I've fully grasped it all 100%, nor could I replicate the entire app from memory, but I definitely understand more than I did before, and I definitely was able to observe Rails' "convention over configuration" approach in action. It was really nifty, and impressive how much you can do with Ruby, allowing it to handle things like the creation of HTML forms and all interfacing with the database.

I'm looking forward to doing more, and really hope that there are enough practice projects and exercises in this curriculum to really help drive these concepts home for me.

God bless.
